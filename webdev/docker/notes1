Dockerizing refers to the process of packaging an application and its dependencies into a Docker container. This makes the application portable and ensures it can run consistently across different environments (such as on different machines or in the cloud).

Hereâ€™s what happens when you dockerize an application:

Encapsulation: The application, along with all of its libraries, environment variables, and dependencies, is bundled into a single unit called a container.

Isolation: Each Docker container runs in its own isolated environment, meaning that multiple applications can run on the same host without conflicting with each other (e.g., conflicting software versions).

Portability: Since Docker containers are standardized, they can run on any system that has Docker installed, ensuring the same behavior regardless of the host environment (whether it's your local machine, a server, or a cloud platform).

Efficiency: Containers are lightweight compared to virtual machines because they share the host operating system's kernel, making them quicker to start and more efficient in resource usage.

To dockerize an application, you typically create a Dockerfile, which contains instructions for how the container should be built, such as which base image to use, how to install dependencies, and how to run the application.
